    "# Analysis of user interaction in Yandex.Zen\n",
    "\n",
    "Users in Yandex.Zen interact with article cards. Each card is defined by its theme and source (it also has a theme). Examples of topics: \"Beauty and health\", \"Russia\", \"Travel\". The users of the system are characterized by the age category.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three ways for users to interact with the system:\n",
    "- The card is displayed for the user (`show`);\n",
    "- The user clicked on the card (`click`);\n",
    "- The user has viewed the card article (`view`).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is necessary to create a dashboard that can answer the following questions:\n",
    "- How many user interactions with cards occur in the system, broken down by card topics?\n",
    "- How many cards do sources with different topics generate?\n",
    "- How do the themes of the cards and the themes of the sources relate?\n",
    "\n",
    "The dashboard will be based on a pipeline that will take data from a table that stores raw data, transform the data and put it in an aggregate table.\n",
