Borrower reliability analysis](https://github.com/tatar-runner/Yandex_Praktikum_english/tree/main/2.%20Borrower%20reliability%20analysis) | Based on the data of the credit department of the bank, the influence of marital status and the number of children on the fact of repaying the loan on time was analyzed. Data information has been received. Identified and processed omissions. The data types have been replaced with the ones corresponding to the stored data. Removed duplicates. Categorized data. One dataframe decomposed into three. | *Python*, *Pandas*, *data preprocessing* |
| [3. Research of real-estate advertisements](https://github.com/tatar-runner/Yandex_Praktikum_english/tree/main/3.%20Research%20of%20real-estate%20advertisements) | Based on the Yandex.Realty service data, the market value of various types of real estate objects, typical parameters of apartments, depending on the distance from the center, were determined. Data preprocessing has been carried out. Added new data. Histograms, boxplots, scatterplots were built. | *Python*, *Pandas*, *Matplotlib*, *data preprocessing*, *data visualization*, *exploratory data analysis* |
| [4. Cellular tariff analysis](https://github.com/tatar-runner/Yandex_Praktikum/tree/main_english/4.%20Cellular%20tariff%20analysis) | A preliminary analysis of the use of tariffs on a sample of customers was carried out, the behavior of customers when using the operator's services was analyzed, and optimal sets of services for users were recommended. The data were preprocessed and analyzed. Hypotheses were tested about the difference in the revenue of subscribers of different tariffs and the difference in the revenue of subscribers from Moscow and other regions. | *Python*, *Pandas*, *Matplotlib*, *NumPy*,  *SciPy*, *descriptive statistics*, *testing of statistical hypotheses* |
| [5. Game sales analysis](https://github.com/tatar-runner/Yandex_Praktikum/tree/main_english/5.%20Game%20sales%20analysis) | The parameters that determine the success of the game in different regions of the world are revealed. Based on this, a report was prepared for a computer games store to plan advertising campaigns. Data preprocessing and analysis were carried out. The current period for analysis has been selected. Compiled portraits of users in each region. Hypotheses tested: the average user ratings of the Xbox One and PC platforms are the same; the average user ratings for the Action and Sports genres are different. In the analysis, I used Student's t-test for independent samples. | *Python*, *Pandas*, *Matplotlib*, *NumPy*,  *data preprocessing*, *exploratory data analysis*, *descriptive statistics*, *testing of statistical hypotheses* |
| [6. Analysis of business indicators of the entertainment application ProcrastinatePRO+](https://github.com/tatar-runner/Yandex_Praktikum_english/tree/main/6.%20Analysis%20of%20business%20indicators%20of%20the%20entertainment%20application%20ProcrastinatePRO+) | Analyzed data from ProcrastinatePRO+. Various metrics were calculated, cohort analysis was used: LTV, CAC, Retention rate, DAU, WAU, MAU, etc. The previously written functions for calculating metrics are used. The correct conclusions are made on the basis of the data obtained. | *Python*, *Pandas*, *Matplotlib*, *Seaborn*,  *cohort analysis*, *unit economy*, *product metrics* |
| [7. Testing hypotheses to increase revenue](https://github.com/tatar-runner/Yandex_Praktikum_english/tree/main/7.%20Testing%20hypotheses%20to%20increase%20revenue) | Hypotheses were prioritized by ICE and RICE frameworks. An analysis of the results of the A/B test was carried out, graphs of cumulative revenue, average check, conversion by groups were plotted, and the statistical significance of differences in conversions and average checks for raw and cleaned data was calculated. Based on the analysis, it was decided that further testing was not advisable. | *Python*, *Pandas*, *Matplotlib*, *SciPy*, *A/B-testing*, *testing of statistical hypotheses* |
| [8. Robocafe opening in Moscow](https://github.com/tatar-runner/Yandex_Praktikum_english/tree/main/8.%20Robocafe%20opening%20in%20Moscow) | The question was investigated - will a cafe be successful and popular for a long time, in which guests are served by robotic waiters. Based on the results of the analysis, a presentation was prepared for investors with recommendations. | *Python*, *Pandas*, *Seaborn*, *Plotly*,  *data visualization* |
| [9. Analysis of user behavior in a mobile application](https://github.com/tatar-runner/Yandex_Praktikum_english/tree/main/9.%20Analysis%20of%20user%20behavior%20in%20a%20mobile%20application) | In this project, the principles of event analytics were studied. A sales funnel was built, the path of users to the purchase was investigated. The results of the A/B test of the introduction of new fonts were analyzed. 2 control groups were compared with each other, conclusions were drawn about the correct division of traffic, a comparison was made with the test group. Revealed that the new font will not significantly affect user behavior. | *Python*, *Pandas*, *Matplotlib*, *Seaborn*, *Plotly*, *testing of statistical hypotheses*, *data visualization*, *product metrics*, *A/B-testing*, *event analytics* |
| [10. Analysis of user interaction in Yandex.Zen](https://github.com/tatar-runner/Yandex_Praktikum_english/tree/main/10.%20Analysis%20of%20user%20interaction%20in%20Yandex.Zen) | Work on this project was carried out on a remote machine in the Yandex.Cloud service. PostgreSQL was installed, the database was deployed. A pipeline script was written that allowed collecting data for a certain time period, and its offline operation via crontab was configured. To visualize the collected data, a dashboard script with several filters was written and also launched on a remote machine. Based on the results, a presentation was prepared with the resulting graphs. | *Python*, *SQLAlchemy*, *PostgreSQL*, *dash*, *Tableau*, *product metrics*, *creating dashboards* |
| [11. Retention of clients of a network of fitness centers](https://github.com/tatar-runner/Yandex_Praktikum_english/tree/main/11.%20Retention%20of%20clients%20of%20a%20network%20of%20fitness%20centers) | This project uses machine learning. The probability of outflow (at the level of the next month) for each client was predicted; typical portraits of users have been formed: the brightest groups have been identified, their main properties have been characterized; analyzed the main features that most strongly affect the outflow. | *Python*, *Pandas*, *Scikit-learn*, *Matplotlib*, *Seaborn*, *machine learning*, *classification*, *clustering* |
