# Testing hypotheses to increase revenue

The study was conducted for the marketing department of an online store in order to prioritize a list of hypotheses about ways to increase the company's revenue and make a decision based on the results of the A/B test. 
 
## A task  
* Evaluate hypotheses by priority
* Analyze A/B test results
* Prepare conclusions for the marketing department

## Libraries
*Pandas*, *Matplotlib*, *SciPy*

To assess the priority of hypotheses, the RICE and ICE frameworks were used.
Formulas and notation:  
*ICE = Impact * Confidence / Efforts*  
*RICE = Rearch * Impact * Confidence / Efforts*

Each parameter was evaluated on a 10-point scale:
**Reach** - reach of users;
**Impact** - impact on users;
**Confidence** - confidence in the hypothesis;
**Efforts** - the cost of resources to test the hypothesis (the higher the score, the more expensive the implementation).
  
All assessment parameters are calculated on a 10-point scale.
