# Research of real-estate advertisements

We need to learn how to determine the market value of real estate. Our task is to set the parameters. This will allow to build an automated system: it will track anomalies and fraudulent activity.

We have at our disposal the data of the Yandex Real Estate service - an archive of ads for the sale of apartments in St. Petersburg and neighboring settlements for several years. Two types of data are available for each apartment for sale. The first ones are entered by the user, the second ones are obtained automatically on the basis of cartographic data. For example, the distance to the center, airport, nearest park and reservoir.

## A task
* Study and preprocess real estate data
* Categorize properties by key parameters
* Determine what factors most affect the cost of an apartment
* Provide recommendations based on the results of the study

## Libraries
