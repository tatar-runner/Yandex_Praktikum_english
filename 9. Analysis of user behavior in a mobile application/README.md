# Analysis of user behavior in a mobile application

The study was conducted for an application for buying food. It was necessary to study user behavior and the sales funnel, as well as conduct a statistical evaluation of the results of the experiment.  
____
## A task
* Study user behavior
* Identify "bottlenecks" in the funnel of events
* Evaluate A/A/B test results for a new font in the app
* Give recommendations 

## Libraries
*Pandas*, *Matplotlib*, *Seaborn*, *Plotly*

## Research results
The funnel of events was studied and the stages were found at which the main losses in conversion to the next event occur. A hypothesis for future research is proposed and the results of the experiment with fonts in the application are evaluated.
