# Retention of clients of a network of fitness centers

The research was conducted for a chain of fitness centers in order to reduce the percentage of customer churn. To solve the tasks, anonymized data of customer profiles, data on subscriptions and customer visits were studied.  

## A task 
* identify patterns in customer behavior prior to churn,
* build a model to predict customer churn,
* provide recommendations for customer retention.  

## Libraries
*Pandas*, *Matplotlib*, *Seaborn*, *Scikit-learn*

## Research results  
A model for predicting the churn of customers in the next month was built using the logical regression algorithm (showed the best metrics).
  
4 customer clusters are identified and detailed descriptions of typical user behavior and other data are given for each.
  
Recommendations are given to improve the quality of work with clients, taking into account the characteristics of each cluster.
